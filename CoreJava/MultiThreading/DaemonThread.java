//ðŸ”¹ First, two types of threads in Java
//User Thread (normal thread)
//Example: main thread, or any thread you create without calling setDaemon(true).
//JVM will wait until all user threads are finished before shutting down.
//Daemon Thread (background helper thread)
//Example: garbage collector thread in JVM.
//JVM will NOT wait for daemon threads.
//If all user threads are finished â†’ JVM shuts down immediately, even if daemon threads are still running.
